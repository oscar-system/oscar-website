title: About the OSCAR project
---

The OSCAR project integrates the four computer algebra systems
[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org), [polymake](https://polymake.org),
[Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de),
and Antic ([Hecke](https://github.com/thofma/Hecke.jl/), [Nemo](https://github.com/Nemocas/Nemo.jl/))
developed within the [TRR 195](https://www.computeralgebra.de/sfb/) into a
visionary next generation open source computer algebra system
surpassing the combined mathematical capabilities of the underlying
systems.

OSCAR allows users to construct new mathematical objects efficiently
by combining existing building blocks from any of the cornerstones and
equip these objects with mathematical capabilities exceeding
those of the individual systems in a transparent way.

## The four cornerstones

This project builds on four leading computer algebra systems which
are, with the exception of the new system ANTIC, widely used
internationally. Although the new computer algebra system tightly integrates
the four cornerstones, the individual
systems will continue to be developed further. This includes working
together with the developers of the individual cornerstones
to develop the cornerstones in a way the best integration can be achieved.

[Nemo](https://github.com/Nemocas/Nemo.jl), [Hecke](http://github.com/thofma/Hecke.jl)
are evolving number theoretic software projects focusing on
computations in and with number fields and generic finitely presented
rings. ANTIC is written in a mixture of C and Julia, building on top
of the very successful [FLINT](http://flintlib.org) project of William Hart, while
Hecke is pure Julia. In order to
reach the mathematical goals of the OSCAR project, the functionality
of both will be considerably extended.


[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org) is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular
emphasis on group and representation theory. One of the distinguishing
features of GAP is that it provides a general purpose high level
interpreted programming language especially suited to algebraic
applications. It is easy to extend GAPâ€™s functionality; currently over
120 GAP packages contributed by third party authors are distributed
with each release.
GAP is integrated into OSCAR via the [GAP.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/GAP.jl) Julia package.

The system [polymake](https://polymake.org) is a standard tool for dealing with convex
polytopes, polyhedral fans, tropical hypersurfaces,
and related objects from combinatorics and
geometry. It is designed as a hybrid written in C++ and Perl. A
sophisticated rule based mechanism decides which low-level C++
functions are to be called to satisfy user demands.
Polymake is integrated into OSCAR via the [Polymake.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/Polymake.jl) Julia package.

[Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de) is a well-established computer algebra system for polynomial
computations, with particular emphasis on applications in algebraic
geometry, commutative algebra, and singularity theory, and with two
subsystems for non-commutative algebra,
[PLURAL](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-2/sing_423.htm#SEC463) and
[LETTERPLACE](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-2/sing_789.htm#SEC841).
Singular has a kernel written in C++ and provides its own
interpreted user language. 
Singular is integrated into OSCAR via the [Singular.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/Singular.jl) Julia package.


## The role of Julia

[Julia](https://www.julialang.org) is a an actively developed
interactive and expressive programing
language. Julia offers

* data types that can depend on other types, for example modeling
matrices over polynomial rings over number fields;
* Just-in-time compilation (JIT) to compile code at runtime to retain
efficient performance;
* capabilities of accessing low-level C/C++ data structures in the
kernels of the cornerstones efficiently;
* easy access to standard third-party libraries, (e.g., for string
manipulation, visualisation, networking).

Julia serves as an integration layer allowing the four
cornerstones to communicate in a more direct way than through
unidirectional interfaces. Furthermore it serves as high-level
language for implementing efficient algorithms utilizing all
cornerstones.
