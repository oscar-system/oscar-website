title: Singular.jl 0.4.5 released
author: Dan Schultz

Here is an overview of the changes in this release of [Singular.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/Singular.jl):

- Addition, subtraction, and multiplication in `QQ` now ensure that the result is reduced. This means that the strange behavior `1/2 + 3/2 = 8/4` should not be observed anymore.
- Various bugs in the wrapper code have been fixed. In particular numerators and denominators are now handled correctly and should not crash.
- Errors such as `1/0` do not leave the Singular kernel in an error state, and thus future calculations should not be poisoned anymore.
- Support for Singular's orderings has been added: `PolynomialRing(QQ, ["x", "y", "z", "t"], ordering = ordering_dp(2)*ordering_wp(2,3))` is the analogue of `ring r = 0,(x,y,z,t),(dp(2),wp(2,3))`.
