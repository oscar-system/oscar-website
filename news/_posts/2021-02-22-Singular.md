title: Singular.jl 0.4.5 released
author: Dan Schultz

Here is an overview of the changes in this release of [Singular.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/Singular.jl):

- Singular.jl should no longer crash on the new rings that Singular creates, or at least it should crash in far fewer cases.
- Singular's algebraic extensions of QQ and Fp can now be constructed via the
function AlgebraicFieldExtension. This function takes a univariate FunctionField
and a minimal polynomial in the function field to create the algebraic extension.
- various small bug fixes


On behalf of the Singular developers,

Dan
