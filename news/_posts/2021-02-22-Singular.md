title: Singular.jl 0.4.5 released
author: Dan Schultz

Here is an overview of the changes in this release of [Singular.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/Singular.jl):

- Singular.jl should no longer crash on the new rings that Singular and its
libraries can create, or at least it should crash in far fewer cases. At a lower
level, this means that we have the internal function `create_ring_from_singular_ring`
for turning a `libSingular.ring_ptr` into a bona fide `Ring`.
- Singular's algebraic extensions of `QQ` and `Fp` can now be constructed via the
function `AlgebraicFieldExtension`. This function takes a univariate `FunctionField`
and a minimal polynomial in the function field to create the algebraic extension.
- Various small bugs have been fixed.
