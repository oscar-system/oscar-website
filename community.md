## How to report issues

If you encounter any problems with OSCAR, please feel free to report the problems as an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/oscar-system). If you are not sure to which part of the OSCAR project the
issue belongs, feel free to submit it as issue to [Oscar.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl).

If it belongs to a different package, we will move it there for you.

To make the issue visible to all participants of the project and to make sorting out responsibilities easier for us, please do not write emails to single people, but post the issue on GitHub.

If you do not want to create an account on GitHub, please send the issue to [OSCAR-dev](mailto:oscar-dev@mathematik.uni-kl.de).

Contributions are welcome. If you want to contribute to OSCAR, you can simply fork the repository you want to  
contribute to and provide a pull request. We recommend that you also (or possibly beforehand) get in touch with us to
