## News about OSCAR

For the latest news on the development on OSCAR, visit the [News]({{site.baseurl }}/news) page.

## Development list

The OSCAR development list is public and can be accessed via the [OSCAR-dev](https://mail.mathematik.uni-kl.de/mailman/listinfo/oscar-dev) page.
It is very low traffic and can be used for questions about OSCAR development.

## Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com) is a non-public chat platform that we use for informal discussions, questions, and so on. Whether you need help installing OSCAR, using it, or writing new code for it, you can ask here. Anyone is welcome to join. [Use this invite link](https://oscar-system.org/slack). You can use it from a web browser, or via one of the many native clients for phones, tablets and computers.

## Discussion forum

We are experimenting with a [GitHub discussion forum](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl/discussions), which also can be used for discussions, questions and so on. Note that it is public, and permanent, while Slack is ephemeral (i.e., discussions there vanish after some time). Using it requires a free [GitHub account](https://github.com).

## How to report issues

If you encounter any problems with OSCAR, please feel free to report the problems as an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/oscar-system). If you are not sure to which part of the OSCAR project the
issue belongs, feel free to submit it as issue to [Oscar.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl).

If it belongs to a different package, we will move it there for you.

To make the issue visible to all participants of the project and to make sorting out responsibilities easier for us, please do not write emails to single people, but post the issue on GitHub.

If you do not want to create an account on GitHub, please send the issue to [OSCAR-dev](mailto:oscar-dev@mathematik.uni-kl.de).

## How to contribute

All software developed for the OSCAR project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/oscar-system).

Contributions are always welcome. If you want to contribute to OSCAR, you can simply fork the repository you want to
contribute to and provide a pull request. We recommend that you also (or possibly beforehand) get in touch with us to
avoid duplication of efforts; we'll also be happy to talk with you about design decisions, help you figure out how
to do things, etc.
