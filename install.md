The OSCAR project initially encompasses a number of different software projects. 
Below are instructions to install the current parts of the OSCAR project.
Please be aware that there is no single OSCAR system, nor a single OSCAR binary
to use yet. For simplicity, we will nevertheless refer to OSCAR during the following
instructions.

OSCAR is currently under heavy development, so all parts
change continuously.

If you only intend to use OSCAR we recommend you install Docker on your machine and
install the OSCAR Docker image, as this is intended to work everywhere.

If you are a developer, you will probably want to know how to install OSCAR yourself.
For that purpose we give install instructions for various platforms below.

## Windows

If you only wish to use AbstractAlgebra.jl, Hecke.jl and Nemo.jl, you can install a
Julia binary from the [Julia website](https://julialang.org) and follow the instructions
for adding the relevant packages, below.

However, if you want to make use of Singular.jl or Polymake.jl, OSCAR cannot run as a
native binary. If you have Windows 10, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux
instead.

### Installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (Windows 10)

  * Search for "Turn Windows features on or off"
  * On the left panel, select "Turn Windows features on or off"
  * Select "Windows subsystem for Linux" and press "Ok"
  * Click "Restart the PC"
  * Click the Windows store icon (shopping bag)
  * Search for "Ubuntu" in the store - it's free!
  * Select "Ubuntu" and "Get" the app
  * Click "Launch" and follow the prompts

You can now follow the instructions for Ubuntu 16.04 below.

To start bash in a later session, just search for "bash".

## Installation for Ubuntu 16.04

First set up a sane build environment:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential m4 wget git \
                     libtool-bin autoconf autogen cmake \
                     libboost-all-dev libxml2-dev \
                     libperl-dev ninja-build \
                     libxml-writer-perl libxml-perl \
                     libxml-libxslt-perl libperl-dev \
                     libxml-writer-perl
{% endhighlight %}

Now install Julia:

{% highlight bash %}
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/0.6/julia-0.6.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvf julia-0.6.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
mv julia-d55cadc350 julia-0.6
{% endhighlight %}

Now start Julia with the right environment setting:

{% highlight bash %}
JULIA_CXX_RTTI=1 julia-0.6/bin/julia
{% endhighlight %}

Now install the relevant Julia packages:

{% highlight julia %}
Pkg.add("AbstractAlgebra")

Pkg.add("Nemo")

Pkg.add("Hecke")

Pkg.clone("https://github.com/wbhart/Singular.jl")
Pkg.build("Singular")

Pkg.clone("https://github.com/ederc/GB.jl")
Pkg.build("GB")

Pkg.clone("https://github.com/oscar-system/Polymake.jl")
Pkg.build("Polymake")
{% endhighlight %}

The whole process will take some time (> 1 hour). But if everything went well, you are
good to go.

Note that the various packages are independent and you do not need to install them all.

## Docker (On Linux/Windows/Mac OS)

The fastest way to get a fully working version of all software packages
in the OSCAR project is using [Docker](http://www.docker.com). To install Docker on your system, follow the instructions on [the Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Once you have Docker installed, you can run the OSCAR Docker image via the command
{% highlight bash %}
docker run -it oscarsystem/oscardocker:latest
{% endhighlight %}

Docker will then download the OSCAR Docker image for you (approx. 6GB), and start a new
shell in a Docker container. You can then start `julia`.

### Jupyter in the Docker container

The Docker image comes fully equipped with the Julia Jupyter kernel. To start Jupyter from
inside the container, start the Docker container with
{% highlight bash %}
docker run -it --net="host" oscarsystem/oscardocker:latest
{% endhighlight %}
In the container's shell, execute
{% highlight bash %}
jupyter notebook --no-browser
{% endhighlight %}
You can then connect to Jupyter by opening `127.0.0.1:8888` in your systems browser.
The password is `oscar`.

## Install OSCAR using conda (Linux)

Installation of OSCAR via the `conda` package manager will be available soon.
