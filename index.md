## Upcoming events

* [LEAN meets MaRDI and OSCAR (5 - 6 Dec, 2024 at TU Berlin).](https://polymake.org/doku.php/workshops/lean_workshop1224)
* [Computational Algebraic Geometry Workshop (18 - 22 Nov, 2024 at Durham University).](https://sites.google.com/view/durhamcompalggeom/home)


## What is OSCAR?

The OSCAR project develops a comprehensive **O**pen **S**ource **C**omputer **A**lgebra **R**esearch
system for computations in algebra, geometry, and number theory, written in [Julia](https://julialang.org). In particular,
the emphasis is on supporting complex computations which require a high level
of integration of tools from different mathematical areas. 

The development of OSCAR is supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG within the [Collaborative Research Center TRR 195](https://www.computeralgebra.de/sfb/).

See the [About]({{site.baseurl }}/about) page for more information.

## Getting started

For tutorials, see the [Tutorials page]({{site.baseurl }}/tutorials), where pre-rendered notebooks showcase
selected things the software developed in the OSCAR project can already do.

<!--
To try OSCAR live from your browser, click on the [binder](https://mybinder.org) links on the Examples page.
At present, these will take a few minutes to load, as we 
currently still build some dependencies from source behind the scenes.
-->

If you wish to contribute to the OSCAR development, see the [Installation page]({{site.baseurl }}/install) for
instructions on how to install it, and also check out our [community page]({{site.baseurl }}/community).
See the [News page]({{site.baseurl }}/news) for announcements about OSCAR development.

## The Book

The book _The Computer Algebra System OSCAR_ presents version 1.0 of OSCAR. It is an invitation
to use OSCAR. With discussions of theoretical and algorithmic aspects included, it offers a
multitude of explicit code snippets. These are valuable for interested researchers from graduate
students through established experts.

Code snippets and list of errata are available on the companion website at
[https://book.oscar-system.org/](https://book.oscar-system.org/)

## Get in touch

A great place to ask questions about OSCAR and discuss all aspects of it is
