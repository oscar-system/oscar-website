*Before* the coding sprints begins, you should install and familiarize yourself with Julia and Oscar if you haven't done so already.

To install:
- Windows users need to first [install **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- Install the Linux or macOS version of **Julia** (Windows users: the Windows version is not supported; use the Linux version via WSL)
- Install **Oscar** [via our install instruction]({{site.baseurl}}/install/)
- Install a programming editor with Julia syntax highlighting

To familiarize:
- Check out (some of) the Julia and Oscar exercises of the [Summer School](https://oscar.computeralgebra.de/meetings/2021-09/exercises/)
