This coding workshops goal is to develop a comprehensive tropical package for OSCAR. Main guideline will be the book "*Introduction to Tropical Algebraic Geometry*" by Diane Maclagan and Bernd Sturmfels. If time permits, further topics are listed in the program. At the end of the meeting, we will also discuss contributing a chapter for the upcoming book of the SFB-TRR.
