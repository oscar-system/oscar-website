## Program
* Start: Monday, February 28
* Finish: Friday, March 4


The main topic of this coding workshop is tropical geometry as represented in the book "*Introduction to Tropical Algebraic Geometry*" by Diane Maclagan and Bernd Sturmfels [MS18]. This includes:

1. Basics of tropical geometry:
   - Tropical numbers
   - Tropical polynomials
   - Tropical matrices

2. Tropical Geometry + Algebraic Geometry:
   - Tropicalization of algebraic varieties
   - Groebner complexes of polynomial ideals

3. Tropical Geometry + Basic Group Theory:
   - see Section 1.6 in [MS18]

4. Tropical Geometry + Basic Number Theory:
   - see Section 2.1 in [MS18]

5. Tropical Geometry + Combinatorics:
   - see Chapter 4 in [MS18]


If time permits, we will look into further topics such as:
   - examples from the forthcoming book "*Essential of Tropical Combinatorics*" by Michael Joswig
   - comprehensive visualization of tropical plane curves as in the Singular library `tropical.lib`
   - tropical varieties of neural networks
   - tropical jacobians
   - 3D printing tropical curves and surfaces
