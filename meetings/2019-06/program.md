## Program
* Start: Tuesday, June 11, at noon
* Finish: Friday, June 14, at noon

We will start with talks about data structures on Tuesday. Wednesday to Friday are reserved for
coding and short discussions when necessary.

### Tuesday

* 12:15: Lunch
* 13:00: Begin
* 14:00: **Overview of core components**
  + Tommy Hofmann: **Hecke.jl**
  + Sebastian Gutsche: **GAP.jl**
  + Sebastian Gutsche & William Hart: **Singular.jl**
  + William Hart: **AbstractAlgebra.jl**
  + William Hart: **Nemo.jl**
  + Marek Kaluba: **Polymake.jl**
* 15:00: Coffee Break
* 16:00: Group photo
* 16:15: Claus Fieker: **Modules in Oscar - An attempt at a unified structure**
> Modules are some of the most fundamental mathematical structures for
> computer algebra, once we move past rings.
> Due to their importance, and due to the many different applications in
> different areas they suffer from an overload of requirements (and too
> many inconsistent bad habits in different areas).
> This tries to define a compromise that allows both sophisticated users
> and beginners to use (at least) some modules for computations.
* 17:15: Mohamed Barakat: **Modeling embedded varieties**
> I will show how to model the Boolean algebra of constructible sets
> in an affine/projective ambient variety starting X
> from the category of free modules over the (homogeneous) coordinate ring of X.
* 19:45 Dinner at the Sommerhaus

### Wednesday

* 10:00 Coding sprint
* 12:00 Lunch
* 13:00 Coding sprint
* 16:00 Status reports
* 16:15 Santiago Laplagne: **Exact polynomial sum of squares decompositions**
> Writing a positive polynomial as a sum of squares (SOS) is an important
> problem in computational mathematics, with many applications in continuous
> and combinatorial optimization.
> A natural question is to which extent can an approximated sum of squares
> decomposition be rounded off to an exact rational decomposition, so a to
> provide a non-negativity certificate. In this talk we first prove that if a
> rational polynomial is the sum of two squares in an algebraic extension of
> odd degree of the rational numbers, then it can always be decomposed as a
> rational SOS. For the case of more than two polynomials we provide an
> explicit example of a rational polynomial that is the sum of three squares
> with coefficients in Q(alpha), alpha the cubic root of 2, that cannot be
> decomposed as a rational SOS.  We will show computations in Maple and
> Singular to answer these questions and find the decompositions.
* 19:00 Dinner
