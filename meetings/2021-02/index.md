# Sage/Oscar Days for Combinatorial Algebraic Geometry (ICERM)

## February 15 - 19, <br> Virtual Reality

## Information

All the information can be found at <https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-s21/w2/>.

### Abstract

> This workshop will focus on the development of software to facilitate research
> in combinatorial algebraic geometry, based on the SAGE Mathematical Software
> System and the OSCAR Computer Algebra System. Special attention will be given
> to efficient computations with multi-variate polynomials, which is a critical
> part of many algorithms in combinatorial algebraic geometry. Aside from
> development of software, the workshop will feature a series of talks about
> polynomial computations, as well as introductory lectures about Sage and
> Oscar.
