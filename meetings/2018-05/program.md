## Results and projects of the week

### Packaging and distribution

- Discussions about how to package OSCAR:
  - Docker
  - Conda

### Changes to packages

- GAP Julia Integration
  - Necessary changes in JuliaInterface/LibGAP.jl to work with the integrated GAP Julia GC
  - Bugfixes in the integrated GAP Julia GC
  - New features in JuliaInterface, JuliaExperimental, and LibGAP.jl
  - Full support of all GAP types in the Julia GC

- Singular Julia integration
  - Partial rewrite of the module code in Singular.jl

- Polymake Julia integration
  - Additional functionality in Polymake, using flint, arb, etc.

- Application of integration
  - Integration of Nemo matrices in LinearAlgebraForCAP via JuliaInterface
  - Using GAP and Hecke in second cohomology computations

- Julia 
  - Exploration of further possibilites of linking Julia and C++
