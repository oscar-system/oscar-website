## Program
* Start: Monday, October 10, at 13:00
* Finish: Friday, October 14, at 13:00

This workshop aims at all levels of OSCAR users and developers.
For beginners, there is an introductory crash course at the start.
We also invited three experts to give accessible introduction to
various topics in computational mathematics. We then will try together to
implement what they covered in OSCAR.

The program below is just a scaffold; more concrete plans
may be added later or during the workshop; e.g. specific times for certain discussions.
If you have suggestions or wishes, please contact [Claus](mailto:fieker@mathematik.uni-kl.de)
and [Max](mailto:horn@mathematik.uni-kl.de).
