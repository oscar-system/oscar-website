## Program
* Start: Wednesday, September 20, at TBA
* Finish: Thursday, Septebmer 21, at TBA

Goal of the meeting is to strengthen existing and explore new collaborations between the [SFB-TRR 195](https://www.computeralgebra.de/sfb/) and [SFB-TRR 358](https://trr358.math.uni-bielefeld.de/).  More concretely, we will be discussing intersections of the OSCAR project with the following projects of the SFB-TRR 358:

* [A2](https://trr358.math.uni-bielefeld.de/projects/view/A2) - Algebraic and arithmetic aspects of aperiodicity
* [A4](https://trr358.math.uni-bielefeld.de/projects/view/A4) - Combinatorial Euler products
* [A7](https://trr358.math.uni-bielefeld.de/projects/view/A7) - Matroids, codes, and their q-analogues

The program is just a scaffold; more concrete plans may be added later or during the workshop.  If you have suggestions or wishes, please contact the organisers.
