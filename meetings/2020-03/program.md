## Program
* Start: Monday, March 2, at noon
* Finish: Friday, March 6, at noon

<!--
We will start with talks about data structures on Tuesday. Wednesday to Friday are reserved for
coding and short discussions when necessary.
-->

The program below is just a scaffold; more concrete plans
may be added later or during the workshop. If you have suggestions or wishes,
please [contact Max](mailto:max.horn@uni-siegen.de).

In general, we want to work on making OSCAR more usable, integrating
the corner stones with each other and into OSCAR.jl, and preparing
for the software demonstration during the SFB presentation in the Summer.

For this, coding and possibly design decisions should be a focus. Talks,
if any, should be focused on this goal.
