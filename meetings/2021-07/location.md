The OSCAR Meeting in July 2021 takes place in virtual space, online,
in our Gather.Town instance (contact the organizers if you do not have
access)

In addition, we will organize a room at the TU Kaiserslautern so that
members of [AGAG](https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/en/agag/) at the
TU Kaiserslautern can join "in presence".
