This summer school aims to teach participants knowledge
about computational algebra, both theoretical and practical. The schedule
will encompass:
- introductory courses by experts on selected topics of computational algebra by
  - [Eamonn O'Brien](https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~obrien/) on algorithmic group theory
  - [Cl√©ment Pernet](https://www-ljk.imag.fr/membres/Clement.Pernet/index.html) on computational linear algebra
- introductory sessions on working with git, Julia, OSCAR
- hand-on training sessions implementing selected algorithms in Julia and OSCAR

The introductory courses require only few prerequisites and will be accompanied
by hands-on programming sessions. While the courses deal with particular
mathematical problems, the techniques introduced have a wide range of
applications, in particular from a practical point of view.
