Before the summer school begins, you should make some preparations; mostly that means
installing a bunch of software on your recommend.

We urge you to do this *before* we start, but if you have trouble with any of it,
then note that Monday morning is set aside for helping each other preparing everything.

- Find a terminal emulator for your operating system and familiarize yourself with the basics
- Windows users need to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and later install Julia in there
- Install OSCAR [via our install instruction]({{site.baseurl}}/install/)
- [Join the OSCAR slack](https://join.slack.com/t/oscar-system/shared_invite/zt-thtcv97k-2678bKQ~RpR~5gZszDcISw)
  (a multi user chat system) and familiarize yourself with it, so that you can get additional support before,
  during and after the summer school.
- If you do *not* have a favorite programming editor with Julia syntax highlighting, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the ["Live Share" plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vslivesharen)
- Install [tmate](https://tmate.io)
- Install either Firefox or a Chrome-derived browser for optimal compatibility with [gather.town](https://www.gather.town)
