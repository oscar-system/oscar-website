## Program
* Start: Monday, September 6
* Finish: Friday, September 10

The aim of the summer school is to teach participants knowledge
about computational algebra, both theoretical and practical. To this end,
we plan the following:
- introductory courses by experts on select topics of computational algebra
- introductory sessions on working with git, Julia, OSCAR
- hand-on training sessions implementing selected algorithms in Julia and Oscar

Details will be announced here and via the SFB mailing list at a later point.
