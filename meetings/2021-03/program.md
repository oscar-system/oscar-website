## Program
* Start: Monday, March 1, at 10:00
* Finish: Friday, March 5, at noon

<!--
We will start with talks about data structures on Tuesday. Wednesday to Friday are reserved for
coding and short discussions when necessary.
-->
The main topics of this coding workshop are:

1. Revising our development model (towards a mono repository?)
   - How to deal with the "JLL hell"?
   - How to efficiently refactor our APIs or move code around when it affects multiple of our packages?
   - We will discuss this some on Monday and then move to implementing solutions

2. Documentation
   - Decide and implement: how will Oscar be documented, as an overall system
     (more than the union of its components)
   - Create, revise, improve documentation



The program below is just a scaffold; more concrete plans
may be added later or during the workshop; e.g. specific times for certain discussions.
If you have suggestions or wishes, please email [Claus](mailto:fieker@mathematik.uni-kl.de) and [Max](mailto:horn@mathematik.uni-kl.de).



<!-- 
In general, we want to work on making OSCAR more usable, integrating
the corner stones with each other and into OSCAR.jl, and preparing
for the software demonstration during the SFB presentation in the Summer.

For this, coding and possibly design decisions should be a focus. Talks,
if any, should be focused on this goal.
