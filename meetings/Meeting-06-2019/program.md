## Program
* Start: Tuesday, June 11, at noon
* Finish: Friday, June 14, at noon

We will start with talks about data structures on Tuesday. Wednesday to Friday are reserved for
coding and short discussions when necessary.

### Tuesday

* 12:15: Lunch
* 13:00: Begin
* 17:45: Group photo
* 18:00: Claus Fieker: **Modules in Oscar - An attempt at a unified structure**
> Modules are some of the most fundamental mathematical structures for
> computer algebra, once we move past rings.
> Due to their importance, and due to the many different applications in
> different areas they suffer from an overload of requirements (and too
> many inconsistent bad habits in different areas).
> This tries to define a compromise that allows both sophisticated users
> and beginners to use (at least) some modules for computations.
* 18:45: Mohamed Barakat: **Modeling embedded varieties**
> I will show how to model the Boolean algebra of constructible sets
> in an affine/projective ambient variety starting X
> from the category of free modules over the (homogeneous) coordinate ring of X.

## Coding Sprints

You can suggest coding sprint topics on the [Wiki](https://github.com/oscar-system/OSCAR-private/wiki/2019-06-Workshop)
